# Fast Word Frequency Analyser
Accelerated Word Frequency Analysis using
CUDA. \
The Word Frequency program with CUDA and OpenMP. Project aims to develop an advanced solution for
efficiently analyzing the frequency of words in large datasets. The project will
leverage NVIDIA's CUDA framework to harness the power of GPUs, surpassing the
performance of traditional CPU-based implementations.
Project Objectives:
1. Implement a word frequency analysis tool that utilizes CUDA technology for
parallel processing on GPUs.
2. Optimize the program to achieve superior speed and performance compared to CPUbased approaches.
3. Enable scalability to handle datasets of varying sizes, ranging from small
files to extensive corpora.
4. Apply robust preprocessing techniques, including tokenization, lowercasing,
punctuation removal, stop-word elimination, and stemming/lemmatization, for
accurate word frequency analysis.
5. Develop a user-friendly command-line interface for easy program configuration,
execution, and generation of comprehensive reports and summary statistics.
6. Explore the use of CUDA Streams to maximize GPU utilization and demonstrate
improved performance (extra points).
7. Investigate a hybrid implementation using OpenMP to harness all system
resources effectively, leading to further performance enhancements (extra
points).
8. Evaluate the performance improvements achieved at each step using profilers and
demonstrate the results in the project report.
The CUDA implementation must be faster than CPU implementations.
Deliverables
